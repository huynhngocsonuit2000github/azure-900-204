# overview

- Core: Azure Function, HTTP Trigger, Timer Trigger, Queue Trigger, Blob Trigger, Even Hub Trigger
- Event-Driven Architecture

# =======

# Core definition

- Azure Function: Azure automatically runs your code only when a trigger happens
- There are some types of Even Trigger
  - HTTP Trigger: run when someone calls an API
  - Timer Trigger: run on a scheduler
  - Queue Trigger: run when a message appears in the Azure Queue
  - Blob Trigger: run when a file uploaded
  - Event Hub Trigger: run when events arrive
- Event-Driven Architecture: the system will reacts to the event, not requests

# =======

# Azure Function Practice:

- Define the necessary variables
- Create resource group
- Create Storage Account, Azure function need storage account to keep "trigger state", **for runtime state, triggers, logs**
- Create Function App
- Create local function project
- Create the HTTP Trigger function inside the function project, this will generate a file `HelloFunc.cs`

```
func new --template "HTTP trigger" --name HelloFunc
```

- Run locally to test

```
func start
```

- Deploy entire local project to the Azure Function App

| Question                               | Simple Answer                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Why need Storage Account?**          | Required for triggers, state, scaling, logs, and runtime metadata.                 |
| **Why create local function project?** | You need a workspace to write, test, and organize your functions before deploying. |
| **What does publish command do?**      | Deploys the entire local project to the Azure Function App (all functions).        |
