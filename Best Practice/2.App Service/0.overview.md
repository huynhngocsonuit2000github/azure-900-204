# overview

- Core: App Service Plan and Web App, Linux runtime, environment variables, logs [TODO]
- Create the simple dotnet web api and deploy to app service, todo application, then deploy via azure portal [TODO]
- Deploy the todo app by using azure CLI [TODO]
- Create the simple angular UI to consume the todo application, which was deployed in the Azure app service, and deploy by using Azure CLI [TODO]
- Create the second App Service Plan, and containerize those two applications and run two applications on that plan [TODO]
- Jenkins CI/CD [TODO]

# Core definition

- App Service Plan: is the machine pool (CPU/RAM/instances and price tier) that the Web Apps/APIs run on. We will pay for the plan, and then we can put one or many apps on it, Those applications will share those machines

  - When we create the Plan, we will chose the region, Operator, SKU. Then we can create the app on that plan
  - When we Reuse the same plan: it will share the same region and OS, similar performances & uptimes needs, and share the resource and cost
  - The disadvantages of running multiples applications on the same App Service Plan: if there is any busy app, it can starve others

- Azure Web App: is an application (code + config + runtime), that will run on the app service plan. The build could be ZIP/Container/GitHub Action

- Linux runtime:

- Environment variables: are simple name/value settings that the application can read at the runtime
