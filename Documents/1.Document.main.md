# Azure Combincation of AZ-900 and AZ-204

> - As cloud computing becomes essential for modern application development, mastering Microsoft Azure is a critical skill for any serious .NET developer. This combined learning path integrates the fundamental cloud knowledge of **AZ-900** with the hands-on, developer-focused skills from AZ-204, giving you a complete roadmap from cloud basics to production-ready app development on Azure.
> - Whether you're new to Azure or already building web APIs, microservices, or serverless apps, this guide will help you:

    - Understand cloud models, architectures, and cost management.
    - Build and deploy .NET apps using Azure services like App Service, Functions, and AKS.
    - Secure applications with Azure AD, Managed Identity, and Key Vault.
    - Integrate messaging, logging, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines.
    - Prepare for both the AZ-900 Fundamentals and AZ-204 Developer Associate certifications.

> - This document is structured for progressive learning, including theory, hands-on labs, and real-world project guidance, which tailored specifically for developers with a .NET background.

### 1. Understand Cloud Concepts (AZ-900 + Developer View)

#### 1.1. What is Cloud Computing? (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

Using remote servers hosted on internet to store, manage and process data instead of on premise server. It is the delivery of computing services such as Servers, Storages, Databases, Networking, Software, Analytics, and Intelligence over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economices of scale. Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers, users can access these services on-demand from a cloud provider like Microsoft Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud

##### 1.1.1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Azure provides **Virtualized Computing Infrastructure**, we can rent **VMs, Storage and Networking**, but we have to be responsible for OS, Update and applications. Some Azure IaaS examples:

- **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**: run Windows/Linux on cloud VMs
- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**: private networks for secure communication
- **Azure Load Balancer**: distributes traffic across services
- **Azure Blob Storage**: store unstructured object data (like images or backups)
- **Azure VPN Gatewat**: connect on-prem networks to Azure

When using IaaS, we have to manage the **operating system, middleware, runtime, and application**, while Azure manages the underlying hardware and virtualization layer

###### 1.1.1.1. Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

Basically, it is a virtual version of physical computer running on Azure. We just need to choose the OS (Windows/Linux), size (CPU/RAM), and install the software. It allows you to deploy and run operating systems, application and custom workloads **just like a physical server**

**Key Concepts**

| Concept                      | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Image                        | Pre-configured OS or app (Windows Server, Ubuntu, SQL Server)  |
| Size                         | Determines CPU, RAM, storage, and cost                         |
| Region                       | Data center where the VM is hosted                             |
| Availability Options         | Ensure high availability: availability Set, Zone, or Scale Set |
| OS Disk/Data Disk            | VM needs a system disk (OS) and optionally extra data disks    |
| Public IP                    | Internet access (optional)                                     |
| NSG (Network Security Group) | Controls what traffic can reach the VM                         |

Noted: **NSG** is a **Cloud firewall** sitting in front of the VM. It filters traffic before it reach to VM. Example when creating the VM, we just enable the VM via port 22 for SSH, after that we deploy the application via port 80 of Nginx server, in that case, we have to config NSG to allow request via port 80 from internet. And also need to make sure the application is listening on the port 80 and allow this port

For VM Security and Best Practices

| Best Practice                 | Why it's Important                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use NSGs                      | Block unsued ports (only allow 22 for SSH or 3389 for RDP) |
| Disable public IP             | Use Azure Bastion or VPN for secure access                 |
| Enable Auth-shutdown          | Save cost by shutting down unused VMs                      |
| Enable baackup and monitoring | Recover and track performance                              |
| Patch OS                      | Use Azure Update Management for automated updates          |

###### 1.1.1.4. Azure Blob Storage [TODO]

###### 1.1.1.5. Azure VPN Gatewat [TODO]

##### 1.1.2. PaaS (Platform as a Service) [TODO]

Azure provides a managed platform for building, testing, deploying, and scaling applications. No need to manage infrastructure or OS updates, Azure PaaS Examples:

- **Azure App Service**: Deploy web apps with auto-scaling and CI/CD.
- **Azure Functions**: Run serverless functions triggered by events.
- **Azure SQL Database**: Managed relational database with high availability.
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Automate workflows using a visual designer.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Container orchestration without managing master nodes.

##### 1.1.3. SaaS (Software as a Service) [TODO]

Azure hosts ready-to-use apps for business needsâ€”users just sign in and use them. Microsoft manages everything, Azure SaaS Examples:

- **Microsoft 365 (Office 365)**: Word, Excel, Teams, Outlook (hosted by Azure)
- **Dynamics 365**: CRM and ERP solutions
- **Power BI**: Business analytics platform
- **Azure DevOps Services**: Code repo, CI/CD pipelines, work tracking
