# What is Cloud Computing
- Using remote servers hosted on internet to store, manage and process data instead of on premise server

# The Evolution of Cloud Hosting
- Dedicated Server
    - Own or rent 1 full server: Expensive, hard to maintain and hardware issues
- Virtual Private Server (VPS)
    - One physical machine is devided into virtual mini-servers: cheaper than a full server, isolated than shared hosting
- Shared Hosting
    - one physical machine is shared by many users: limited control, performance issues, poor isolation
- Cloud Hosting
    - many machine connected as one "virtual system" (the cloud), flexible and scalable, auto-backup, auto-recovery, good isolation
    - Pay what you use (Example: electricity, Uber or Grab)

# Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Cost-effective, Secure, Reliable, Scalable, Elastic, Current

# Types of Cloud Computing
- SaaS: software as a service
- PaaS: platform as a service
- Iaas: infrastructure as a service

# Azure's Deployment Models
- public cloud: built on the cloud provider - cloud native
- private cloud: on-premise, the cloud could be OpenStack, to manage and host the infrasructure list Azure/AWS
- Hybrid: using both on-promise and a Cloud Service Provider. That way is used to utilize the existing infrastructure investments, sensitive application for some sticky requirement, still want to scalable
